# Development Log

This is an append-only, chronological audit log for the two Windows applications in this repository. Add an entry for every substantive project-related task, including decisions, requirements, bugs, code/UI/assets/build changes, test outcomes, releases, and deferred items. The current source, commit history, workflow logs, and artifacts remain authoritative.

## 2026-10-22 — Establish persistent project context and logging policy

- **Reason:** Preserve project continuity across ChatGPT conversations and maintain a repository-owned record independent of chat memory.
- **Projects covered:** Resolver Reach and Ollama GGUF Importer.
- **Audited source:** Root `README.md`; `src/ResolverReach/ResolverReach.csproj`; `src/OllamaGgufImporter/OllamaGgufImporter.csproj`; `.github/workflows/ollama-gguf-importer.yml`; `src/OllamaGgufImporter/README.md`.
- **Verified versions at time of audit:** Both project files declare version 1.0.0 (assembly/file version 1.0.0.0). Re-check before any future release/version claim.
- **Verified required features in documentation/source configuration:** Both applications display product-version information and include Save Logs functionality. Resolver Reach exports a session summary and endpoint results. Ollama GGUF Importer exports the activity log, application status, and import queue to UTF-8 text.
- **Documentation change:** Add `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the persistent project overview and working agreement; add this log as the chronological record; link both from the root README.
- **Build/test status for this documentation-only task:** Repository files were read through the connected GitHub integration. No local compile, runtime test, or GitHub Actions run was executed as part of this documentation change. Do not interpret this entry as a build-success claim.
- **Future action rule:** Whenever future work changes source, UI, assets, configuration, build, or documentation, append an entry describing exactly what changed and what verification was actually performed before the task is considered complete.
