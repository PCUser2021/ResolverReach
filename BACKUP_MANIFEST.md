# Resolver Reach project backup manifest

Snapshot date: 2026-10-23  
Primary repository: https://github.com/PCUser2021/ResolverReach  
Visibility at last check: **private (awaiting GitHub UI visibility change)**  
Product version: **Resolver Reach 2.0.0**  
The source history includes Resolver Reach and Ollama GGUF Importer.

## Authoritative tracked backup

The private Git repository is the authoritative, versioned backup of source and project records. The user has now explicitly authorized making the source repository public; the current connected toolset cannot execute GitHub's repository-visibility setting, so the change remains pending the repository owner's Settings action.

- Main branch backup head: check the current `main` ref before relying on this snapshot.
- Stable backup branch: `backup/ResolverReach-2.0.0-2026-10-23`.
- Resolver Reach 2.0.0 redesign merge: commit `35ff1517f7e0c0ce42fe1a8500935123d922dd30`.
- Successful Windows x64 publish/installer build: [workflow run #39928118989](https://github.com/PCUser2021/ResolverReach/actions/runs/39928118989).
- Project source and icon: `src/ResolverReach/`.

## Public page preparation

- Root `README.md` begins with the Resolver Reach icon and a preview of the v2.0.0 UI. The preview is an illustration and **not** a screenshot captured from the running app.
- Root `LICENSE.txt` includes the requested personal/home-use restrictions and explains that public source visibility cannot be blocked by the license wording.
- Proposed GitHub About/Description text is in `public-distribution/REPO_DESCRIPTION.txt`. It must be copied into the GitHub About settings manually because no repository-metadata-write operation is available in this session.
- GitHub visibility remains private until changed in the web UI: https://github.com/PCUser2021/ResolverReach/settings.

## Visibility warning

Once the private source repository becomes public, GitHub makes all committed code visible, allows public forks, and exposes Actions history/logs. The repository's own history also contains repository-related prompt archive entries and development notes. The user has explicitly authorized source publication in Prompt 009.

## ChatGPT memory limitation

The complete ChatGPT platform-level Memory store and every historical chat cannot be exported through the connected tools. Repository-related prompts, decisions, implementation notes, build validation and handoff state are preserved in `PROMPT_ARCHIVE.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`; that is not a full platform Memory export.
